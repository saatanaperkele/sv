A few reasons exist for wanting to develop this services bot. For one, I am not a fan of nickname registration, but I still believe in having a straightforward way for people to identify themselves reliably. Atheme and other services can do username registration in place of a NickServ, so making a new bot just for that reason would be foolish, right? Another reason for working on my own services: channel registration. Outright registration seems to go too far; it implies that channels are personal property, and I do not believe channels nor nicknames should be permanently owned. On the other hand, lack of any services could lead to unruliness. To find a balance between the two, I decided on giving the first op of a channel "founder" access, which would allow the user to run the channel for as long as there were other people in it as well. This would cut down on abandoned channels; after registering one, someone forgets about it and it doesn't expire for a week or a month
